    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1. What I'm working on to have a dream of who I want to be when I'm older and I still haven't decided yet. Right now, I've set up goals that's going to help me find my dream so that's why I set a goal that going to help me learn new experiences and motivate me and setting other new goals.

2. The ways I am working on to achieve my goal is by putting all of my effort in trying to be the very best I can be and to never give up. My education in school has help me learn a lot of new things and use them in a daily life. 

3. One of the values that I consider most necessary for my success is "Don't give up till it's over." And another value I consider is "Take charge of your own destiny." 

4. One of the short-term goals I have that I want to accomplish is to stress less and know it's ok not to always finish everything in time and do not rush. Another short-term goal that I want to accomplish is to learn from others and ask for help whenever you need it, it does not hurt to ask at all.

5. The character traits that I most want to be known for being ambitious, hardworking, imaginative, organized, and independent. For my achievements, I want to be most known for helping someone in need, remaining calm in a trying situation, and to never fall but I rise again after I fall.<p>
